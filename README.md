1. deathlink has not been created yet. Useless setting
2. starting craft has 3 settings

     0 is for no starting craft besides examine
   
     1 has only the best starting craft for each person
   
       Siffrin: make up the time
   
       Mirabelle: Super Sparkle Heal
   
       Isabeau: YOUR TURN!!!
   
       Odile: Rock III
   
     2 is all starting craft
   
4. susChecks makes it so anywhere you'd gain a sus point is a location check.
     This is not the same as everywhere that the sus animation plays

Take all the files in the ISATMod folder and place them into your ISAT's WWW folder, replacing them.
